            HATIL traces its roots to H.A. Timber Industries Ltd, a company 
            established in 1963 by late Al-Haj Habibur Rahman. Following his 
            footsteps, HATIL, as a singular furniture brand, came into being 
            under the leadership of Selim H. Rahman, a veteran and visionary 
            leader in country's furniture industry.
